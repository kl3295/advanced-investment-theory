This project aims 1) to build a factor-based model allocation namely a Long/Short Global Macro Strategy with a Target Beta and 2) to evaluate its sensitivity to variations of Beta and its sensitivity to the length of the estimators for covariance matrix and the expected returns under different market scenarios.
